* **Teresa Huang** Submitted Report on Brightspace
* **Ziyang Fang** Submitted Presentation on Brightspace

## Compile and Run

#### Download and Compile

1. Download the source code.
2. Compile in an IDE of your choice.

#### Run the Code

1.Run`MessageServerMaster.java`.

2.Run`MessageClient.java`and allow the program to run in parallel so that multiple clients can run at the same time.

#### Quit the application

1. Click on the "X" on the upper right corner to end the client.
2. Click on the red square in IntelliJ (or an IDE of your choice) to terminate MessageServerMaster.

## Detailed Description of Each Class

### System Classes

#### `ServerMaster`

This class ensures that every user has their own thread to connect to the server.

#### `ServerWorker`

This class will define what type of request is first and then sign the local variable“response” to it. Once the system
finds it, it will go to find the corresponding response method. Next, the system will find the needed information and
call the method from the message system to realize its objective. After collecting the information from the message
system, it will send a response back to the client with the needed data.

#### `Database`

This class will save all the messages from the Message System, check if there is a txt, read the data and save it into a
hashmap, then refresh the file, wait for the next message from the Message System, and it should have a function that
can let Message System use the information which saves in the hashmap easily.

#### `MessageSystem`

This class contains many methods which are used to realize the specific implementation from the server and give a value
back to the server.

#### `MessageClient`

This class contains the graphical user interface and functions for clients. There are four inner classes in
MessageClient. The`MessageClient`class includes the main method and invokes the Window class. The`window`class contains
the components in the graphical user interface, and the action listeners. The`ClientWorker`fetches data from the server
and processes data when the users do action. ClientWorker sends requests to the server and receives corresponding
responses in order to implement the specified action. The`ListDisplay`is used by the JList for real-time updates to
display conversations and messages.

### Data Structure Classes

#### `public class Conversation`

The class stores the information of a conversation.

- `String name`The name of the conversation.

- `UUID[] user_uuids`An ArrayList containing the UUIDs of the members.

- `UUID admin_uuid`The UUID of the administrator.

- `UUID[] message_uuids`An ArrayList of the UUIDs of the messages.

#### `public class Message`

The class stores the information of a message.

- `UUID sender_uuid`The UUID of the message sender.

- `Date time`The time that the message is sent.

- `String content`The content of the message.

- `UUID conversation_uuid`The UUID of the conversation that the message belongs.

#### `public class User`

The class stores the information of the user.

- `Credential credential`The credential of the user.

- `Profile profile`The profile of the user.

#### `public class Credential`

The class stores the credential of the user.

- `String usrName`The username of the user.

- `String passwd`The password of the user.

#### `public class Profile`

The class stores the profile of the user.

- `String name`The name of the user.

- `int age`The age of the user

#### `public abstract class Storable`

The class stores UUIDs.

- `UUID uuid`A unique and exclusive used to identify objects.

#### `public class EventBag`

The class stores the event that is used for live-update

- `ArrayList<User> new_users`newly created users.

- `ArrayList<Conversation> new_conversations`newly created conversations.

- `HashMap<UUID, Arraylist<Message>> new_messages`newly created messages.

## Testing

### AutomaticTesting

All the automatic tests are conducted with JUnit 4. And for each method in Database and MessageSystem, one successful
case and one exception expected case are provided.

#### Test for Database

The Database test is included in DatabaseTest.java, which contains a write method test. The write method contains all
the methods that been used in the Database. So successful running of the write method will automatically mean that other
methods are running without problems.

Note: this test case can be found at`DatabaseTest.java`in the root folder.

#### Test for MessageSystem

The MessageSystem test is more complicated than the database test. It is in the MessageSystemTest.java. Also, the
adding, remove and edit method of each field had been tested with different Test methods. For instance, the test method
for getUser included the addUser and deleteUser method so successful running of the getUserTest will approve that
addUser and deleteUser could run in that situation. Another addUserExceptionExpected test method, which included
throwing an expected exception when certain invalid input is provided, is also written in the test class. Every method
in the MessageSystem contains an exception expected test case and a successfully running test case, to make sure the
program didn't crash even invalid input is provided.

Note: this test case can be found at`MessageSystemTest.java`in the root folder.
